It seem easy to write a test case, but it's not easy to write a good test case. A good test case shouldn't break easily when you make small changes to your code. In this article, I will guide you how to write a good assertion by using matchers in JavaScript unit testing using Vitest.

## What are assertions and matchers?

- An assertion is a statement that checks if the actual value of a test case is equal to the expected value.

- A matcher is a function that compares the actual value with the expected value and returns a boolean value (true or false) to indicate if the assertion is true or false.

In a testcase, the assertion is important because it helps you verify that the code works as expected or not.

## Common matchers

In Vitest, there are several matchers that you can use to write assertions in your test cases. Here are some common matchers:

### Equality

- `.toBe` compares **primitive values** or checks referential identity of object instances.
- `.toEqual` compares recursively all properties of object instances (also known as "deep" equality).

You can see the difference between `toBe` and `toEqual` in the following example:

<BlockCode fileName='src/tests/assertions.test.js'>
```js
it('toBe with primitive values', () => {
  const a = 1;
  const b = 1;
  expect(a).toBe(b); // true
  expect(a).toEqual(b); // true
});
it('toEqual with objects', () => {
  const obj1 = { a: 1, b: 2 };
  const obj2 = { a: 1, b: 2 };
  expect(obj1).toBe(obj2); // false
  expect(obj1).toEqual(obj2); // true
});
```
</BlockCode>

### Numbers

- `toBeGreaterThan`
- `toBeGreaterThan()`
- `toBeGreaterThanOrEqualTo()`
- `toBeLessThan()`
- `toBeLessThanOrEqualTo()`
- `toBeCloseTo()` checks if the actual value is close to the expected value within a given precision.

<BlockCode fileName='src/tests/assertions.test.js'>
```js
it('toCloseTo with floating point numbers', () => {
  const a = 0.1 + 0.2;
  expect(a).toBe(0.3); // false
  expect(a).toBeCloseTo(0.3); // true
});
```
</BlockCode>

### Strings

- `toMatch` compares the actual value with the expected value using a regular expression.

### Objects

- `toMatchObject` compares the actual value with the expected value using a partial object.
- `toHaveProperty` checks if the actual value has the expected property.

<BlockCode fileName='src/tests/assertions.test.js'>
```js
it('toMatchObject and toHaveProperty', () => {
  const obj1 = { a: 1, b: 2 };
  const obj2 = { a: 1 };
  expect(obj1).toEqual(obj2); // false
  expect(obj1).toMatchObject(obj2); // true
  expect(obj1).toHaveProperty('b'); // true
});
```
</BlockCode>

### Arrays

- `toHaveLength` checks if the actual value has the expected length.
- `toContain` checks if the actual value contains the expected value.

<BlockCode fileName='src/tests/assertions.test.js'>
```js
it('toContain and toHaveLength', () => {
  const arr = [1, 2, 3];
  arr.push(5);
  expect(arr).toContain(5); // true
  expect(arr).toHaveLength(4); // true
});
```
</BlockCode>

You can find the full list of matchers in the [Vitest documentation](https://vitest.dev/api/expect).

## Writing a good assertion

To write a good assertion, you need to choose the **right matcher** for the test case.

- A too loose assertion is one that is not specific enough, potentially leading to false positives (test passes when the code is actually incorrect). For example:

<BlockCode fileName='src/tests/assertions.test.js'>
```js
it('too loose assertion', () => {
  const sum = 1 + 2;
  expect(sum).toBeDefined(); // Always pass because it only checks if the value is defined
  expect(typeof sum).toBe('number'); // Always pass because it only checks if the type is correct
  // Should be checked with strict equality
  expect(sum).toBe(3);
});
```
</BlockCode>

- A too tight assertion is one that is overly specific, potentially leading to false negatives (test failures when the code is actually correct). For example:

<BlockCode fileName='src/tests/assertions.test.js'>
```js
it('too tight assertion', () => {
  const errorMsg = 'Page not found';
  expect(errorMsg).toBe('Page not found'); // Pass if the error message is exactly the same
  // Should be checked with regular expression
  // It will pass even if the error message is 'Page not found' or 'Page not found.' or 'Page not found!'
  expect(errorMsg).toMatch(/not found/i);
});
```
</BlockCode>

Remember that depending on the context, you may need to use different matchers to write good assertions. The example above is not always correct, but it helps you understand the concept of loose and tight assertions.

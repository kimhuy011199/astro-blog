## What are assertions and matchers?

- An assertion is a statement that checks if the actual value of a test case is equal to the expected value.

- A matcher is a function that compares the actual value with the expected value and returns a boolean value (true or false) to indicate if the assertion is true or false.

In a testcase, the assertion is important because it helps you verify that the code works as expected or not.

## Common matchers

There are many matchers available in Vitest. Here are some common matchers:

- `toBe`: Compares the actual value with the expected value using strict equality (`===`).
- `toEqual`: Compares the actual value with the expected value deeply.
- `toMatch`: Compares the actual value with a regular expression.
- `toContain`: Checks if the actual value contains the expected value.
- `toThrow`: Checks if the actual value throws an error.

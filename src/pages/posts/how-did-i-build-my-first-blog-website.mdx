## Why I Bult This Blog?

When I was a university student, I've been always thinking about launching my personal website and personal blog. I believe that writing a blog offers numerous benefits:

- When I document my researching, challenges, and solutions, I created a repository of information that I can refer back to in the future. This also helps me to reinforce what I've learned.
- Moreover, crafting quality blog posts requires careful research and attention to detail, encouraging me to delve deep into topics and gather insights from various sources.
- As a non-native English speaker, blogging presents an opportunity to significantly enhance my English skills.

These benefits, among others, motivated me to invest time in building this blog and starting to write this post.

## What Tech Stack I Used?

After researching about how to build a blog website, I founded [Astro](https://astro.build/). Astro is the web framework for building content-driven websites like blogs. It offers everything I need, like showcase my content, managing routes, optimizing for search engines, and ensuring fast performance...

With my solid two years of experience using [TailwindCSS](https://tailwindcss.com/), I felt confident in using it to style my blog.

All my blog posts are written in Markdown format, I also use [MDX](https://mdxjs.com/), which combines Markdown with JSX, making it easy to import interactive components and embed them within my content.

Additionally, I utilized [React](https://react.dev/) to add interactive features such as a table of contents and search functionality, enhancing the user experience and engagement on my blog.

In software development, mistakes in commits happen more frequently than we would prefer.
Imagine you are working on a feature branch and accidentally commit sensitive information, like an API key, or commit to the wrong branch.
You quickly realize the need to undo these changes, but as you search for solutions, you come across two common commands: `git reset` and `git revert`.
Each offers a way to return, but which is right for your situation?

In this article, I will explore both commands, how they work, when to use them, and how to decide which approach best addresses your specific needs.

## Three trees in Git

Before getting started, it's important to understand Git's internal state management systems, called "Git's three-tree":

1. **Working Directory**: This is the workspace on your local machine, it reflects the current state of your files and any changes made that have not yet been staged or committed.
   You can see changes in the **Working Directory** with `git status`.

2. **Staging Index**: This space holds a snapshot of changes ready to be committed.
   After you've made changes in the **Working Directory**, you can add them to the **Staging Index** with `git add`.

3. **Commit History**: This is the timeline of saved changes in your project.
   When you use the `git commit` command, it takes the changes from the **Staging Index** and adds them to this history as a new commit.

The animation above demonstrates Git's three-tree structure by showing the creation of `file1.js` and committing it as `C1`. We add two more examples: `file2.js` as a `C2` commit and `file3.js` as a `C3` commit.
These three commits will be used throughout the article as we explore `git reset` and `git revert` commands.

## Undoing commits with `git reset`

The `git reset` command allows you to undo changes in your working directory by moving the branch tip back to a specific commit and discarding all commits made after that point.

<Video src='https://res.cloudinary.com/cloudinaryassets/video/upload/v1734441214/astro-blog/git-undo-commits/wqz9ixebshcgsz3a958x.mov' />

After running the command `git reset HEAD~1`, you'll notice two changes:

1. The branch tip has moved to the commit `C2`.

2. The latest commit `C3` has been discarded from the commit history.

The `HEAD~1` is a way to reference the commit before the current `HEAD`. You can use similar syntax to go back further, like `HEAD~2` to go back two commits from `HEAD`.
Alternatively, you can specify a particular commit using its hash ID.

The next question is where did the changes from `C3` commit go? (the `file3.js` in this example). Did it delete permanently, or is it saved somewhere?
This is where the git reset flags come into play. Bypassing one of the following flags, you can control the changes:

- `–-soft`: It undoes the commits in the history and places the changes back in the **Staging Index**, ready to be committed again if needed.

- `—-mixed` (this is the **default option**): It is similar to `—-soft` but also clears the **Staging Index**. This means any changes from the discarded commits are left unstaged in the **Working Directory**, requiring you to re-add them before re-committing.

- `--hard`: This option clears all changes from both the **Staging Index** and **Working Directory** and resets the codebase to match the specified commit without making any modifications.

By using `git reset`, you've successfully undone a specific commit.
However, try to push these changes to the remote repository with a regular `git push`.
You'll get an error because the local commit history no longer matches the remote.
To push these changes, you need to use a force push (`git push –force`).
While this command will update the remote branch, it comes with risks – it can overwrite the remote history, creating potential issues for other developers.
To avoid these problems, let's explore a safer alternative:

## Undoing public commits with `git revert`

The `git revert` command is an undo command, but it doesn't work like the git reset.
Instead of removing a commit from the project history, it creates a new one containing the inverse of the original changes.

The result of running the command `git revert HEAD` is a new commit that undoes the changes made in the `C3` commit.
Since the `C3` commit added `file3.js`, the revert will effectively delete this file.
In short, running `git revert HEAD` will bring your code back to its state at the `C2` commit.

You can prevent `git revert` from automatically creating a new commit by using the `-n` or `–no-commit` flag.
With this option, the inverse changes are placed in the **Staging Index** and **Working Directory**, allowing you to review or modify them before committing.

The `git revert` command allows you to go back to previous commits without removing any mistake commits.
It doesn't re-write the project history.
Because of this, this command should be used to undo changes on a public branch.

## What is the difference between Git Reset vs. Git Revert?

The difference between `git reset` and `git revert` is that `git reset` should be used to undo changes in your local history, while `git revert` should be recommended for undoing changes on a shared or public branch.
Both `git reset` and `git revert` are commands for undoing changes, but they work differently in key ways:

|              | git reset                                                                          | git revert                                                                         |
| ------------ | ---------------------------------------------------------------------------------- | ---------------------------------------------------------------------------------- |
| How it works | Reverts to a previous state by removing the specified commit.                      | Reverts to a previous state by creating a new commit with inverse changes.         |
| Options      | Offers `-–mixed`, `-–soft`, and `-–hard` flags to control how changes are handled. | Offers `--no-commit` to add inverse changes without automatically committing them. |
| Usage        | Recommended for undoing changes in your local history.                             | Recommended for undoing changes on a shared or public branch.                      |

## Conclusion

By now, you should clearly understand how to undo changes in a Git repository using `git reset` and `git revert`.
In short, use `git reset` for local-only history changes, and `use git revert` to undo changes on a shared branch safely.
Choosing the right command for your situation lets you keep your project history clean and ensures smoother collaboration with your teammates.
